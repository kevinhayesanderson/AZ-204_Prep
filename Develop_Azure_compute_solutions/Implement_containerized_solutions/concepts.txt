An Azure container registry stores container images and OCI artifacts.

An image or artifact consists of a manifest and layers.

A manifest describes the layers that make up the image or artifact. It is uniquely identified by its digest.

An image or artifact can also be tagged to give it a human-readable alias. An image or artifact can have zero or more tags associated with it, and each tag uniquely identifies the image.

A collection of images or artifacts that share the same name, but have different tags, is a repository.
